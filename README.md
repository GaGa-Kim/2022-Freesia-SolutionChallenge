## ✨ Introduction
&nbsp; **I'm your freesia** is a reboot platform that uses Google Maps API to introduce nearby re-education institutions and motivates women to re-employment with various features.

Our solution is named after freesia, a flower with the meaning of "cheering for a new start, challenge".
<br/><br/>

## ✨ freesia’s Goal
### What's the problem?
&nbsp; One of the still unresolved social problems in Korea, the "women's career disconnection." About 38% of married women aged 15 to 54 suffer career breaks due to pregnancy/birth and child-rearing after marriage. It takes them an average of 8.4 years to get a job again. Even if they succeed in reemployment, it is rare that a "quality" job is guaranteed to continue their existing career. Eventually it is not a success.

&nbsp; Fear is the main factor that hinders career-broken women from reemployment. Most of them are frustrated with their disconnected careers and afraid of new beginnings. Therefore, for career-broken women to get a real "successful" reemployment, it is important not only to provide quality education but also to provide a mechanism for them to look back and motivate themselves. This will certainly help them grow by awakening their potential while maintaining their existing careers.

<h3 align="center"><b>So,</b></h3>

&nbsp; We intend to solve the problem of "gender equality" in Korea by creating a reboot platform that helps career-broken women with get quality jobs again. Through this platform, it is expected that career-broken women will not only receive high-quality educational information, but also share information with each other and grow further. In addition, if this female workforce can be fully utilized, it will help Korea's economic growth.
